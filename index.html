		<h1>What is it?</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<p>dbdeploy is a Database Change Management tool. It's for developers or
			DBAs who want to evolve their database design &ndash; or refactor their
			database &ndash; in a simple, controlled, flexible and frequent manner.</p>
	</div>

<div class="row">

		<h1>Why do I need it?</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<p>The recurring problem with database development is that at some point
			youâ€™ll need to upgrade an existing database and preserve its content.
			In development environments it's often possible (even desirable) to
			blow away the database and rebuild from scratch as often as the code
			is rebuilt but this approach cannot be taken forward into more
			controlled environments such as QA, UAT and Production.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<h1>How do I use it?</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<p>Drawing from our experiences, we've found that one of the easiest ways
			to allow people to change the database is by using version-controlled
			SQL delta scripts. We've also found it beneficial to ensure that the
			scripts used to build development environments are the exact same used
			in QA, UAT and production. Maintaining and making use of these deltas can
			quickly become a significant overhead &ndash; dbdeploy aims to address this.</p>

		<h1>Wait...WHAT? A new website?</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<p>Don't understand what's going on? There are some new people interested in moving
			this project forward, so the first thing we're doing is creating a new website.</p>

		<h1>Now what?</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<p>Watch this space!  Over the next couple of months (as of April 2013), we will
			start adding things &ndash; both to this website, and to the project itself!</p>
