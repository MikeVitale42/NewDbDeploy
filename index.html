			<h1>What is it?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			<p>dbdeploy is a Database Change Management tool. It's for developers or
				DBAs who want to evolve their database design &ndash; or refactor their
				database &ndash; in a simple, controlled, flexible and frequent manner.</p>
		</div>

			<h1>Why do I need it?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			<p>The recurring problem with database development is that at some point
				you'll need to upgrade an existing database and preserve its content.
				In development environments it's often possible (even desirable) to
				blow away the database and rebuild from scratch as often as the code
				is rebuilt but this approach cannot be taken forward into more
				controlled environments such as QA, UAT and Production.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="row-fluid">
			<h1>How do I use it?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			<p>Drawing from our experiences, we've found that one of the easiest ways
				to allow people to change the database is by using version-controlled
				SQL delta scripts. We've also found it beneficial to ensure that the
				scripts used to build development environments are the exact same scripts used
				in QA, UAT and production. Maintaining and making use of these deltas can
				quickly become a significant overhead &ndash; dbdeploy aims to address this.</p>

			<p>dbdeploy automatically keeps track of which delta scripts have been applied to
				your databases, and helps you incrementally change your database over time
				without having to resort to big-bang approaches</p>

			<h1>Wait...WHAT? A new website?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			<p>Yes, indeed! There are some new people interested in moving this project forward,
				so the first thing we're doing is creating a new website.</p>

			<p>New builds are coming soon!</p>

			<h1>Now what?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			<p>Watch this space! Over the next couple of months (as of April 2013), we will
				start adding things &ndash; both to this website, and to the project itself!</p>
